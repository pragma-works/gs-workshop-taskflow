## Transaction Integrity & Financial Data Precision

- Never use floating-point types for monetary values. Use fixed-precision decimal types (e.g., `Decimal`, `BigDecimal`, `NUMERIC(19,4)`) or integer minor units (cents/pips) throughout the entire stack.
- Ensure all financial operations are ACID-compliant. Use database transactions with appropriate isolation levels (at minimum READ COMMITTED; use SERIALIZABLE for balance mutations).
- Implement double-entry bookkeeping: every transaction creates at least two ledger entries (debit and credit) that sum to zero. Validate this invariant on every write.
- Make all transaction processing idempotent using client-supplied idempotency keys. Retry-safe APIs prevent duplicate charges or transfers.
- Record immutable transaction history. Financial records are append-only; corrections are modeled as reversing entries, never as in-place updates or deletes.
- Perform end-of-day reconciliation between internal ledgers and external payment processor/bank records. Alert immediately on any discrepancy.
- Store and display all monetary amounts with their ISO 4217 currency code. Never assume a default currency.

## Audit Trails & Regulatory Compliance

- Maintain a tamper-evident, append-only audit log for every state change to accounts, transactions, and user permissions. Include actor, timestamp, old value, new value, and IP address.
- Implement PCI-DSS controls if handling cardholder data: network segmentation, encryption, access logging, vulnerability scanning, and annual compliance assessments.
- Mask or tokenize sensitive financial identifiers (account numbers, SSNs, card PANs) in logs, error messages, and non-production environments.
- Enforce KYC/AML checks at onboarding and on an ongoing basis. Integrate with identity verification and sanctions screening providers via well-defined service boundaries.
- Retain financial records and audit logs for the period required by applicable regulations (typically 5-7 years). Automate archival and ensure archived data remains queryable for audits.
- Design for regulatory reporting: build data models and pipelines that can produce required reports (SAR, CTR, regulatory filings) with minimal manual intervention.

## Security & Operational Resilience

- Implement multi-factor authentication for all user-facing financial operations above a configurable threshold (e.g., transfers > $500).
- Apply velocity checks and fraud detection rules: flag unusual transaction volumes, amounts, geographies, or timing patterns for review before processing.
- Use cryptographic signing (HMAC or asymmetric signatures) for all webhook payloads, inter-service financial messages, and API requests to prevent tampering.
- Design for graceful degradation: if an external payment provider is unavailable, queue transactions for retry rather than failing the user experience entirely.
- Maintain a disaster recovery plan with RPO < 1 hour and RTO < 4 hours for critical financial services. Test failover procedures quarterly.
- Separate read and write paths for high-throughput systems. Use CQRS to ensure reporting queries never contend with transaction processing.

## Financial Simulation & Backtesting Invariants

Financial simulations fail in two directions, both silently. Name them explicitly
so every engineer on the team recognizes the pattern immediately.

### Category A — Silent Loss Bugs (strategy runs, earns nothing)

These bugs produce flat or zero P&L while the simulation completes without error.
The strategy appears to have run. It did not.

**1. P&L decomposition invariant**
At finalize: `fee_income + price_income == total_pnl ± 1%`.
A gap larger than 1% means an accounting component is unlinked — it exists
in the ledger but never flows into the reported total.

**2. Fee-time ratio**
Fees must be proportional to active simulation time. Near-zero fees after
1000 hours of "running" means the instrument was never created. The strategy
ran against nothing. Check: `total_fees / active_hours < threshold` → flag.

**3. State concentration**
If >80% of simulation time is spent in a single non-productive state
(e.g. `crash_short`, `emergency`, `waiting`), the state machine is stuck.
A stuck machine is not a conservative strategy — it is a broken one.
Surface this in finalize as a warning, not a footnote.

### Category B — Silent Gain Bugs (inflated returns from accounting errors)

These bugs produce plausible-looking positive returns. They are harder to catch
because the output looks like a win.

**4. Return plausibility**
For a market-neutral strategy: annual return >200% or `total_pnl / fee_income >10×`
is almost certainly a bug, not alpha. Fee income is ground truth of actual activity.
A strategy that earns 10× its fees in price income has a broken hedge or look-ahead leak.

**5. Delta neutrality**
Track `avg |net_delta|` while in the primary running state.
High average delta = the hedge is broken, bootstrapped incorrectly, or bypassed.
This check surfaces bootstrap order bugs that only appear mid-simulation.

**6. Instrument balance**
Sub-strategies should be sized proportionally per the allocation spec.
If one instrument is 5× larger than another at finalize, allocation logic failed.
Check: `max(instrument_notionals) / min(instrument_notionals) > 3× → warn`.

### Integration requirements

- All 6 checks run in the harness `finalize()` step, printing alongside standard metrics.
- Failed invariants logged as `[INVARIANT FAIL]` — not swallowed as warnings.
- Checks are parameterized: thresholds in config, not hardcoded.
- All 6 checks have unit tests with synthetic data that triggers each failure mode.

### Volatility unit convention

Unit confusion in vol calculations is the single most common source of both false crash
triggers and missed recovery conditions in DeFi and market-neutral strategies.

- Vol fields stored as `percentage_per_period` must never be re-transformed with
  `/ sqrt(N)` or `* 100` after storage. Storing already-scaled vol and scaling again
  = off by 10×–100× with no runtime error.
- Label every vol field with its unit in the variable name or type alias:
  `vol_pct_per_day`, `sigma_annual` — never just `vol` or `sigma`.
- Annualization convention must be a named constant: `TRADING_DAYS_PER_YEAR = 252`
  (or 365, or actual — choose one, name it, use it everywhere).
