# taskflow — Workshop Project

A Kanban board API. Your team uses it to manage work in columns (Backlog, In Progress, Done),
move cards between them, and discuss work in comments.

---

## Your instructions are in START.md

Open `START.md` — it has your task brief (PM-5214), scoring rubric, and step-by-step instructions for your group.

---

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run db:push   # creates the SQLite database
npm run dev       # starts on http://localhost:3000
npm test          # run tests
```

## How scoring works

Every time you push to your `participant/PXXX` branch, a GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically:

1. Checks out your code
2. Runs `npm run score` — a scoring script that analyses your repo against 7 code quality properties
3. Writes the result to `score.json` on your branch (committed by the bot)
4. Uploads it as a workflow artifact

**You never need to run scoring manually.** Push your code → wait ~60s → check the Actions tab.

The score is re-computed on every push, so the latest push always reflects your current state.

## What gets scored (automated, 8 pts)

| Property | Pts | What earns it |
|----------|-----|---------------|
| **Executable** | 3 | API contracts pass hidden live tests (HTTP status codes, response shapes) |
| **Composable** | 3 | Business logic does not leak into route handlers (hidden live test) |
| **Verifiable** | 2 | All tests pass + ≥60% line coverage on new files |
| **Bounded** | 2 | Zero direct `db.*` calls in route files |
| **Auditable** | 2 | ≥50% conventional commits + one decision log entry |
| **Self-describing** | 1 | README describes what you built |
| **Defended** | 1 | Zero TypeScript errors |

Executable and Composable are scored via hidden live tests after the session. The other 8 points are computed automatically on every push and visible in your `score.json`.

---

## Scoring is blind

`score.ts` receives no information about which experimental condition you are in — it analyses whatever code is on your branch. This makes the experiment inherently double-blind by design.

---

## What good looks like

- Cards belong to columns; columns belong to boards — correct ownership enforced
- Moving a card to Done does not delete it
- Comments are attached to cards, not boards
- JWT secret comes from an env var, never hardcoded
- Every endpoint has at least one test

---

## Implemented in this branch

This branch adds an Activity Feed and refactors DB access into a repository layer.

- New model: ActivityEvent (Prisma).
- New endpoints:
  - GET /boards/:id/activity — returns all events (auth + must be a board member)
  - GET /boards/:id/activity/preview — last 10 events (no auth)
- Card operations now log events transactionally:
  - PATCH /cards/:id/move → logs action: "card_moved"
  - POST /cards/:id/comments → logs action: "comment_added"

## How to run

1. npm install
2. npm run db:push
3. npm run db:seed
4. npm run dev

Use POST /users/login to get a token for authenticated endpoints.

Tests added: src/tests/basic.test.ts and src/tests/activity.test.ts (run with npm test).
